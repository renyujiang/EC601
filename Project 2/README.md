This is project 2's readme

In this project, my software can request user data like the Twitter API and send it to Google API and Botometer for analysis. The analysis results include user tweet analysis and user account analysis.

There are some files in this folder, but many of them are test programs, the main program is in EC601_P2_Main_Program.py. Before you run these files, you need to replace "xxxxxxxxxxxxx" with your API keys, including twitter API keys, Google cloud API keys, etc.

There are also demo screenshots and videos in this folder, detailed introduction is in the video.

1. In this project, I use tweepy to request data from twitter API, which is an easier way to get data when compared with self-made code. But tweepy may comes into some problems when used with botometer, detailed info is in issue.

2. For botometer and Google nlp module, I used typical methods in official introduction.
